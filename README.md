# Construction plans and (hopefully) finished projects

This is a collection of projects that required a drawing of some sort or in other ways could be interesting looking back at at a later date.
I'm in no way trying to be coherent in my ramblings but if there is anyone interested in more info about a specific project, just shoot me an issue.

## Electronics
### Slot-Car controller modification

## Woodworking
### Bookshelf (built in)
### Office Desk
